# New Features: 3D Maps, Operational Notifications, and Breakpoints for Grid Missions

To streamline your autonomous drone operations and tackle common challenges such as limited flight time, terrain awareness, and keeping remote teams informed about flight operations, our latest release introduces several powerful features. You can now benefit from **3D Map View in Fleet Management**, receive **Operational Notifications**, and use **Breakpoints in Grid Missions** for DJI Dock & Dock 2. These enhancements are designed to integrate elevation data with satellite maps for improved terrain awareness, enable grid missions over larger areas without flight time constraints, and ensure your remote drone team stays informed with essential operational updates.

Dive into the details below to learn how these features can benefit you and your operations:

* **3D Map View in Fleet Management**
  * Complementing the existing 2D map, the 3D map view is now available in Fleet Management. Users can interact with the map using their mouse or trackpad to view and evaluate the operational area from various perspectives.
  * 3D Maps enable informed mission planning and setting of flight paths as per the general terrain at the site of operations.

* &#x20;**Operational Notifications**
  * Emails regarding operational notifications can be automated for routine and failsafe actions taken by any drone. This ensures that operators stay informed about device status and critical actions even when away from the Dashboard.
  * This feature enhances operational reliability for users conducting autonomous dock-drone operations.

* &#x20;**Breakpoints in Grid Mission**
  * Users can now execute grid missions over extensive areas without being constrained by drone flight time. These missions can be paused and resumed, allowing completion over multiple flights. The drone re the interruption point and marks the mission as incomplete, facilitating seamless mission continuation.
  * This feature is particularly beneficial for industries like construction, mining, and solar energy, where large-area surveys are frequently required.
