# Support for Sniffer4D Nano 2

We've added support for the Sniffer4D Nano2 multi-gas detection system. This integration enables your drone operations to capture live gas concentration data and environmental conditions directly through the FlytBase platform. The system provides readings for critical gases, including CO, CO2, SO2, NO2, and particulate matter, alongside meteorological data.

FlytBase now displays live gas concentration levels from all active sensor modules, with automatic meteorological data (temperature, humidity, pressure) shown as soon as your drone powers on. Operators can toggle between volumetric and mass units depending on their reporting requirements or regulatory standards. The system supports automated monitoring through DJI Dock 2 and FlytBase integration, enabling remote and scheduled environmental assessments.

### Key Applications

The Sniffer4D Nano2 integration addresses critical monitoring challenges across multiple industries including greenhouse gas monitoring, oil & gas pipeline inspection, industrial emissions monitoring, HAZMAT emergency response, environmental research, and landfill management. Each application leverages FlytBase's automation capabilities to reduce operational costs, enhance safety, and ensure regulatory compliance.

The integration enables three powerful automation approaches:

#### **Preventive Monitoring**

> _Mission Scheduler → Automated Flight → Real-time Data Collection → Dashboard Analysis → Compliance Reports_

Scheduled automated missions enable routine compliance monitoring, pipeline inspections, and environmental studies. This workflow ensures consistent data collection while reducing operational costs and maintaining regulatory compliance through systematic monitoring programs.

#### **Incident Response (Manual Trigger)**

> _Emergency Alert → GTL (Go-To-Location) → Immediate Deployment → Live Assessment → Manual Override for Investigation_

Manual deployment for emergency situations provides rapid response capabilities for HAZMAT incidents, suspected leaks, and critical situations. GTL functionality enables immediate drone deployment to incident locations with real-time assessment before personnel deployment, ensuring safety and immediate situational awareness.

#### **Integrated Alarm Response (Fully Automated)**

> _Ground Sensors Detect Leak → Webhook to FlytBase Alarm Flinks → Automatic Drone Deployment → Pre-planned Mission → Live Data Streaming → Manual Control for Detailed Analysis_

Seamless integration with existing gas monitoring infrastructure enables fully autonomous emergency response. When ground sensors detect anomalies, webhooks automatically trigger drone deployment, execute pre-planned assessment missions, and provide live data streaming to operators who can then take manual control for comprehensive environmental analysis.
