# 3D Mission Planning

FlytBase introduces **3D Mission Planning** — a powerful new capability that lets operators create and visualize drone missions in a fully interactive 3D environment. In addition to setting altitudes relative to terrain using **Above Ground Level (AGL)**, users can now clearly view waypoint positions, route paths, and potential terrain conflicts in real time while planning.

3D Mission Planning on FlytBase plays a key role in enabling safe, accurate, and efficient autonomous drone operations—especially in environments where terrain and elevation change frequently. By bringing spatial context directly into the mission planning workflow, it helps teams better prepare for complex scenarios and execute flights with greater confidence.

## **Key Use Cases and Benefits:**

* **Visualizing Complex Flight Paths**\
  For missions with multiple waypoints or proximity to infrastructure, the 3D view offers clear insight into how the route moves across varied terrain. This improves situational awareness and reduces the likelihood of planning errors.
* **AGL-Based Altitude Validation**\
  In sites like mines, refineries, and construction zones, operators can assign waypoint altitudes relative to the ground surface (AGL). This ensures safer clearance above terrain and better alignment with site conditions.
* **Enhanced Pre-Flight Safety**\
  The 3D interface helps identify potential altitude conflicts early in the planning process. This reduces mid-mission interventions and supports safer, more reliable autonomous flights—especially for **BVLOS** operations.
