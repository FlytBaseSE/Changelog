# Introducing Drone and Payload control access transfer

Today, we bring you features designed to streamline your remote drone operations. Dive into our _new drone and payload access transfer_ for improved team coordination, benefit from seamless _remote firmware upgrades_, and leverage the ease of cloud-based _logs upload._ Our commitment remains: to simplify your remote operations, letting you focus more on objectives and less on challenges.

### üîÑ Drone and Payload Access Transfer: Enhanced Safety, Compliance, and Collaboration

Following our last release that allowed organization members to view all online members in drone details, enhancing team collaboration, we're introducing another pivotal feature to further improve operational safety, and compliance, and minimize human errors. We recognized that in organizations with multiple online members, there was potential for confusion, miscommunication, and overlap in drone and payload control. Such overlaps could lead to non-compliance with operational protocols or regulations, and increase the risk of errors. To address this, we've made a pivotal change.

* Real-time Control Visibility: Now, if John Doe, a member of your organization, executes a takeoff, you can instantly view it on the dashboard. Similarly, if Jane Smith takes control of the payload, that too is immediately visible. This transparency ensures everyone is aware of who's in charge of what, reducing the chances of inadvertent overlaps.
* Exclusive Control Mechanism: To ensure clarity and safety, only one operator can have control of a specific drone flight at any given time, while another can exclusively control its payload if required.
* Permission-based Control Transfer: If another member wishes to assume control of either flight operations or the payload, they must explicitly request permission from the current operator. This structured handover process guarantees a seamless transition, minimizing human errors and ensuring strict adherence to operational standards.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Firmware Upgrade: Remote and Efficient

The need to be physically present for firmware upgrades was a challenge we wanted to address. Now, you can remotely upgrade your drone and dock's firmware, ensuring they're always equipped with the latest features.

* Remote Upgrades: Introducing the ability to upgrade firmware without being on-site.
* Choose Your Version: Specify the firmware version directly from the FlytBase dashboard.
* Real-time Upgrade Tracking: Our firmware upgrade percentage bar keeps you informed, so you're never left guessing.

### üìäLogs Upload

We recognized another challenge you faced when hardware-specific issues arose. The traditional method required you to be on-site to download logs from the RC or the dock, and then send them to the hardware manufacturer. Not anymore!

* Cloud-based Uploading: Directly upload drone and dock logs to the cloud from the FlytBase dashboard. No need to be on-site.
* Tailored Log Requests: Request a list of logs for each device and choose specific logs for uploading.
* Stay in Control: Changed your mind mid-upload? You can cancel it anytime.
* Progress Tracking: Monitor your upload's progress with our new progress bar, ensuring you're always informed.
