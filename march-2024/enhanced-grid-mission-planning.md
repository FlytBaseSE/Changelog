# Enhanced Grid Mission Planning

FlytBase is excited to announce significant enhancements to the Grid Mission Planning workflow. We've refined the user interface to ensure a more intuitive planning and editing experience. Additionally, you can accurately adjust flight parameters like Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) and Image Overlaps to fine-tune your missions. This enables optimal data collection for mapping and surveying applications.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the new features:

* **Payload Selection:** Users now have the option to choose between the M30 and M30T payloads, enabling them to select the most suitable imaging sensors for their specific missions.
* **Automatic Altitude Adjustments:** FlytBase automatically adjusts the flight altitude to meet the mission's requirements, taking into account the selected payload, imaging sensor, and the Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) specified by the user.
* **Customizable Image Overlaps:** Users can now set Front and Side Image Overlaps to their required values. These adjustments automatically modify the mission's flight speed and grid path density.
* **Adjustable Camera Angles:** Users can set precise gimbal pitch and drone yaw angles, ensuring that the images captured during the mission align perfectly with their specific requirements.
* **Mission Overview:** Key mission details, including the area covered, time needed to complete the mission, and the number of images to be captured, are displayed in a dedicated section during the mission planning process for easy reference by the user.
