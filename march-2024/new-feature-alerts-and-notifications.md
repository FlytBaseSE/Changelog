# New Feature: Alerts and Notifications

FlytBase is excited to announce the launch of our new Alerts and Notifications feature, designed to enhance the safety of BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) drone operations on the FlytBase Dashboard. This innovative addition aims to significantly increase situational awareness and improve control over your drone fleet.

Here’s a summary of what you can look forward to:

Alerts: Stay on top of critical events with Alerts that inform you of potential risks—be it the proximity of manned aircraft within your operating area or malfunctions that activate device failsafes. These alerts are essential for taking timely measures to safeguard your equipment and other assets.

Notifications: Track the results of your actions effortlessly. Whether a command issued from the FlytBase Dashboard is successful or not, you'll receive instant notification pop-ups at the top of your Dashboard. For your convenience, all notifications are also logged in the Notifications Center for easy reference.

Sound Notifications: Boost your responsiveness with sound notifications. Opt to receive auditory alerts for critical updates, ensuring that you never miss important information.

For detailed guidance on how to utilize these exciting new features to their fullest potential, please refer to our updated [documentation](https://docs.flytbase.com/in-flight-modules/alerts-and-notifications).
