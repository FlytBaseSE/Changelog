# AI-R: Thermal Detections and Real-Time Email Alerts

## Thermal Feed and Split View AI Detection Support

**AI-R now supports real-time AI detection on thermal video feeds**, enabling accurate identification of people and vehicles in **low-light and night-time conditions**.\
\
This capability is now extended to **Split View**, allowing simultaneous detection across both **thermal and RGB feeds**—improving situational awareness and enabling faster response during critical operations.

#### Key Highlights:

* **Thermal AI Detection** for both people and vehicles class type
* Ideal for **night-time surveillance** and **low-visibility environments**
* **AI detection in Split View**, enabling simultaneous detection on both **thermal and RGB feeds**
* Fully integrated with existing **AI-R detection workflows and alerts**

## Real-Time Email Alerts for AI Detections

A major update for real-time situational awareness, **AI Detection Email Alerts** allow users to receive real-time notifications when a person or vehicle is detected during a mission — without needing to constantly monitor live video feeds.

Each alert includes essential metadata such as detection type, timestamp, and GPS coordinates, enabling faster decision-making and effective incident documentation.

#### Key Highlights:

* **Real-time email alerts** triggered by AI-based detections
* **Detection class filtering** to receive alerts only for selected object types (e.g., person, vehicle)
* Alerts include **timestamp**, **GPS location**, and **object classification**
* **All alerts are logged** for historical access and review
