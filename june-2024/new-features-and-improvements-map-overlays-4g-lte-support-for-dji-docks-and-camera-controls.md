# New Features and Improvements: Map Overlays, 4G LTE Support for DJI Docks, and Camera Controls

FlytBase is excited to announce the launch of the Map Overlays feature, along with 4G LTE Support for DJI Dock and Dock 2. Additionally, the Camera Controls for DJI Dock and Dock 2 have been updated for advanced payload management. These updates improve mission planning awareness, increase safety with backup communication, and allow for flexibility in media capture. Here’s an overview of what’s new:

1. **Map Overlays**
   * Import 2D maps and images to substitute and update old maps on public mapping services and monitor recent changes in infrastructure and terrain for improved planning and operations.
   * Modify existing missions by accounting for new maps, thus ensuring safer mission planning and execution and enhancing flight safety. Map Overlays are ideal for users inspecting dynamic locations like mines and construction sites.
2. **4G LTE Support for DJI Dock and Dock 2**
   * Extend your operational range with 4G LTE communication and ensure communication backup during critical missions.
   * Operate smoothly in regions with weak RF signals due to interference or local regulations, minimizing frequent RC link losses and improving reliability.&#x20;
3. **Advanced Camera Controls for DJI Dock and Dock 2**
   * Detailed control of payload cameras is now possible with features like Smart Low Light, Exposure Control, IR Metering, and Focus modes.
   * Optimize camera settings for your imaging and video recording needs, and capture more detail in challenging imaging conditions.
