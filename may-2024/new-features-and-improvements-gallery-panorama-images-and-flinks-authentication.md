# New Features and Improvements: Gallery, Panorama Images, and Flinks Authentication

FlytBase is excited to introduce some major updates and new features to our platform. These changes are designed to enhance your experience in managing drone-captured media, increase imaging capabilities, and provide an additional layer of security to Flinks. Here’s what’s new:

* **Enhanced Gallery**:&#x20;
  * Your photos and videos are now automatically organized into folders, each folder corresponding to a unique Flight ID.&#x20;
  * You can use new filters to sort and manage your media more effectively.
* **Panorama Image Capture**:
  * You can now capture Panorama images during Path Missions using DJI Dock.
  * DJI Dock and Dock 2 can also capture Panorama images whenever the drone is hovering for a 360-degree situational awareness.
* **Increased Security for Flinks**:&#x20;
  * Alarm sources integrated with FlytBase using Flinks will now require Access tokens to verify their authenticity as genuine alarm sources, thus making Flinks secure.
  * Developer settings allow Organization Owner and Admins  to set static or dynamic Access tokens for their Alarm sources depending on the situation and nature of the source.

These updates and features are designed to enhance your FlytBase experience, making it more efficient and reliable. For more information, please refer to our [documentation](https://docs.flytbase.com/).
