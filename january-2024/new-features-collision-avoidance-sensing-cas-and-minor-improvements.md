# New Features: Collision Avoidance Sensing (CAS) and minor improvements

We are excited to announce our latest FlytBase release, which enhances situational awareness during BVLOS operations with our new feature: Collision Avoidance Sensing (CAS). CAS enables your drone to detect obstacles in real-time using its vision and infrared sensing systems, allowing it to identify objects and stop at a predetermined braking distance. Additionally, we have made improvements to the Flight Logs.

Collision Avoidance Sensing (CAS): Configure Collision Avoidance Sensing (CAS) for your drone through the DJI Pilot 2 app by setting the warning and braking distances. The drone will detect obstacles in real-time and avoid collisions.

1. Enhanced Operational Safety: The drone will stop at the configured braking distance if any obstacle is detected, ensuring safety during autonomous operations.
2. Improved Situational Awareness: With the Navigation Display showing real-time obstacle data, operators can manually control the drone on the FlytBase dashboard without any worries.

Here's the [documentation ](https://docs-dji.flytbase.com/device-management/new-collision-avoidance-sensing-cas)to learn more.

**Flight Logs Improvements:**

1. Added more visibility to the overview section for scenarios where the Dock and the Drone go offline during a flight.

This update aims to improve your drone's operational safety and your situational awareness during flights. In case you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to support@flytbase.com.
