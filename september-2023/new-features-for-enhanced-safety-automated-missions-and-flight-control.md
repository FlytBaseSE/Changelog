# New Features for Enhanced Safety, Automated Missions & Flight Control

Imagine you're at your remote command center, ready to deploy your DJI Dock and M30 drone. The success of your mission depends on reliable equipment, precise mission planning, and the ability to respond swiftly to unexpected situations. We've heard your feedback and are excited to introduce significant enhancements that cater to your needs.

## Health Management System

When you power up your drone and dock, you'll notice the "Diagnostics" feature in the Device Maintenance Page. This offers real-time health monitoring, ensuring timely issue detection and reporting. Safety and reliability are our top priorities. Learn more about the Diagnostics feature [here](https://docs-dji.flytbase.com/features/management/devices/health-management-system).

## Mission Scheduler

This feature allows you to plan and schedule missions in advance, with the option to repeat them as needed. Set waypoints and actions for your flight path and make real-time adjustments as required. Explore the Mission Scheduler feature [here](https://chat.openai.com/c/link-to-documentation).

## Abort Functionality

Safety remains a priority, particularly during critical manoeuvres. With the "Abort Functionality," you gain the ability to halt your drone's current action during launch to location and return to the docking station maneuvers. Think of it as an emergency brake for your drone, ready to respond swiftly to unexpected situations. Learn how to use the Abort Functionality [here](https://chat.openai.com/c/link-to-documentation).
