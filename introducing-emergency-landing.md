# Introducing Emergency Landing

## **Introduction**

FlytBase introduces the **Emergency Landing** â€”an essential safety mechanism enabling operators to perform immediate, controlled landings during unforeseen situations. Whether due to a docking station malfunction or abrupt weather changes, this capability ensures drones can be safely recovered, particularly during **BVLOS**, **security patrols**, and **industrial inspections**, where minimizing risk is critical.

## **Key Features**

* **Dashboard-Based Emergency Access**\
  Operators can trigger an emergency landing directly from the drone control panel on the  **Operations Dashboard**, streamlining decision-making during critical events.
* **One-Click Descent with Confirmation**\
  Initiate a controlled landing at the drone's current in-flight position with a single click. A confirmation prompt prevents accidental activation.
* **Precise Location Tracking for Recovery**\
  After landing, FlytBase displays the **last known GPS location** on the map, aiding fast ground-team recovery and minimizing drone downtime.
