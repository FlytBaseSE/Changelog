# Introducing Thermal Alerts

We are excited to introduce **Thermal Alerts**, a powerful feature designed to improve real-time situational awareness for operators using drones with thermal payload. With Thermal Alerts, operators can proactively monitor objects within the droneâ€™s field of view and set alerts based on temperature thresholds detected by the thermal camera. This ensures timely detection of temperature anomalies, enabling more effective decision-making in security, inspection, and emergency response scenarios.

#### Key Features:

* **Dynamic Thermal Sensitivity:** Operators can switch between low-gain and high-gain thermal modes to optimize detection sensitivity based on environmental conditions.
* **Real-Time Alerts & Notifications:** Users can configure sound alerts on the FlytBase dashboard to receive instant notifications when objects fall **outside** the defined temperature range.
