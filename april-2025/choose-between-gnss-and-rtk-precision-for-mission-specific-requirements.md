# Choose Between GNSS and RTK Precision for Mission-Specific Requirements

## **Introduction**

We’re excited to add the **Positioning Accuracy** settings in Mission Planning — empowering drone operators with the ability to fine-tune how drones determine their location during missions. Whether you're surveying expansive fields or conducting high-precision infrastructure inspections, this update brings flexibility and control tailored to your operational needs.

## **Key Features**

* **Configurable Positioning Accuracy**: Choose between **GNSS** and **RTK** based on the precision requirements of your mission.
  * **GNSS Mode**: Utilizes satellite-based positioning with standard accuracy levels.
    * **Horizontal Accuracy**: ±1.5 m
    * **Vertical Accuracy**: ±0.5 m
    * **Best suited for**: General surveillance, site overview, and missions where sub-meter precision is not critical.
  * **RTK Mode**: Engages Real-Time Kinematic corrections for ultra-precise localization.
    * **Horizontal Accuracy**: ±0.1 m
    * **Vertical Accuracy**: ±0.1 m
    * **Recommended for**: High-resolution inspections, photogrammetry, and mapping missions demanding centimeter-level accuracy.
* **Seamless Integration**: Easily select your preferred positioning mode while creating or editing missions—no extra steps required.

## **How to Access**

* Navigate to **Mission Planning** on the FlytBase Dashboard.
* Create or edit a **Path** or **Grid** Mission.
* Under **Mission Parameters**, locate the **Positioning Accuracy** section.
* Select either **GNSS** or **RTK** based on your requirement.

## **Benefits**

* **Mission Flexibility**: Adapt your missions depending on the operational context—no need for one-size-fits-all precision.
* **Improved Inspection Quality**: RTK ensures accurate station-keeping, especially critical in close-quarters or detailed inspection environments.
* **Operational Efficiency**: Avoid unnecessary setup when GNSS is sufficient, and switch to RTK only when accuracy demands it.
