# Introducing Point Cloud and Elevation Map Overlays

## Introduction

We're excited to announce a significant upgrade to FlytBase's mapping capabilities. Until now, users could only leverage 2D overlays for mission planning and analysis. With this release, FlytBase now supports **Point Cloud Map Overlays** and **Elevation Map Overlays**, enabling more precise 3D visualization, terrain awareness, and survey-grade accuracy for enterprise drone operations.

Whether you're conducting aerial inspections, surveying complex topographies, or ensuring situational awareness in remote environments, this enhancement unlocks new layers of operational insight across industries like construction, energy, agriculture, and public safety.

### Key Features

* **Point Cloud Map Overlays (LIDAR-based)**
  * **LAS (.las):** Industry-standard format for high-precision 3D point clouds from aerial LIDAR surveys.
  * **LAZ (.laz):** Compressed LAS files with full data fidelity for efficient, high-volume terrain mapping.
* **Elevation Map Overlays**
  * **TIFF/GeoTIFF (.tif/.tiff):** Supports high-resolution, georeferenced imagery for elevation analysis.
  * **IMG (.img):** Optimized for large-area elevation datasets from remote sensing workflows.
  * **DEM (.dem):** Digital Elevation Models for detailed terrain profiling and topographic analysis.

### Benefits

* Enhanced situational awareness with accurate 3D context.
* Improved mission planning across varied terrains and topographies.
* Seamless integration of survey data into your drone workflows.
* Reduced risks and better-informed decisions for BVLOS operations.
