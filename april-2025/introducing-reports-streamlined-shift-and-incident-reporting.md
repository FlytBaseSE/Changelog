# Introducing Reports: Streamlined Shift & Incident Reporting

### Introduction

Enterprise drone operations generate vast amounts of flight data and media—yet transforming this into actionable, audit-ready documentation has long been a manual, time-consuming task. FlytBase Reports changes that. With the new Reports module, organizations can now automatically compile Day/Night Shift Reports and Incident Reports based on flight logs, observations, and media—all from within the FlytBase platform. This advancement significantly accelerates how drone teams log, review, and share mission-critical findings, making post-flight workflows faster, clearer, and more collaborative.

### Key Features

* **Shift & Incident Reports in Minutes:** Automatically generate structured reports tied to drone flights. Choose from pre-defined shift durations or custom time windows, ensuring consistent and reliable documentation for daily ops or critical incidents.
* **Embedded Observations with Evidence:** Annotate visual findings directly on captured media and attach them to observations. These become part of the report, offering rich visual context to support operational decision-making.
* **Multi-Flight Compilation:** Select multiple flights to consolidate findings into a single report. This enables holistic analysis of drone activity across time periods or incident timelines.
* **Collaborative Review & Audit Trails:** With standardized formatting and easy PDF export, reports are ideal for internal review, cross-team communication, or external audits—whether in high-security environments or regulatory submissions.
* **Media Downloads with Annotations:** Each report supports downloadable media in both original and annotated formats—ensuring key findings remain accessible, shareable, and defensible.

### Benefits to Users

* **Faster Post-Flight Turnaround:** Reduce hours of manual work into minutes with auto-generated summaries.
* **Operational Clarity:** Capture the ‘what, when, and where’ of your missions with structured observations and visual context.
* **Enhanced Accountability:** Maintain consistent reports for audits, insurance claims, and stakeholder reporting.
* **Cross-Team Visibility:** Security, inspection, and compliance teams all stay aligned with standardized shift and incident reporting formats.
* **Long-Term Traceability:** Store, revisit, and re-export historical reports to compare past events and track trends.
