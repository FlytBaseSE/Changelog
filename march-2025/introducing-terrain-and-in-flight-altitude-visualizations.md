# Introducing Terrain and In-Flight Altitude Visualizations

## Introduction

FlytBase is committed to enhancing operational safety and efficiency for drone operators across various sectors, including surveillance, security, inspections, and public safety. With the introduction of  **Terrain and In-Flight Altitude Visualization**, operators can now plan missions with greater precision and monitor flights in real-time, ensuring safer and more effective operations.&#x20;

This feature is available for **Waypoint Missions, Grid Missions, and Go To Location (GTL) tasks**, ensuring comprehensive terrain awareness for all mission types.

## Key Features:

* **Terrain Profile Graph**: Get a **detailed graphical representation** of elevation changes across mission waypoints, helping operators assess altitude variations and optimize flight paths.
* **Reference Altitude**: Choose between Relative to Takeoff (RLT) or Above Ground Level (AGL) as the reference altitude for Go To Location (GTL) missions, enabling terrain-aware navigation to specific locations.
* **In-Flight Altitude Monitoring**: Access real-time altitude information relative to the drone's current flight level, including parameters such as maximum flight altitude, proximity to the docking station, and distance from ground, enhancing situational awareness during flights.
