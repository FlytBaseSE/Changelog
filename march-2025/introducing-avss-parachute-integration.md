# Introducing AVSS Parachute Integration

### Introduction

We’re thrilled to introduce the AVSS Parachute Integration—an advanced safety mechanism that provides both automated and manual emergency landing capabilities for DJI drones operating with FlytBase. By continuously monitoring flight parameters and triggering rapid parachute deployment, this integration significantly reduces operational risks and helps ensure regulatory compliance for flights over populated areas and BVLOS operations.

This feature is currently compatible with the DJI Dock 2 and supports specific drone models, including the DJI M3D and M3TD.

### Key Features

* Automated & Manual Deployment Deploy the parachute in under 0.5 seconds when critical failures are detected, or via manual trigger on the Operations Dashboard. This dual approach ensures safety under both autonomous and operator-led scenarios.
* Real-time Parachute Monitoring Continuously tracks the parachute system’s readiness, alerting operators to armed, disconnected, or error states so they can respond immediately.
* Secure Controls with Visual Feedback Operators receive clear on-screen indicators to confirm successful activation or any system alerts during or after deployment.
* PRS + FTS Integration incorporates a Parachute Recovery System (PRS) and a Flight Termination System (FTS) for the PRS-M3DTEX variant offering faster and more reliable activations, providing added layers of operational safety.
* After the parachute deployment, FlytBase displays the last known GPS location of the drone on the map, aiding fast ground-team recovery and minimizing drone downtime.

### Key Benefits

* Enhanced operational safety with reliable parachute deployment that mitigates risks from hardware failures or unforeseen flight anomalies.
* Regulatory compliance built to align with ASTM F3322-22 and EASA MOC 2512 standards, expediting approvals for BVLOS or urban missions.
