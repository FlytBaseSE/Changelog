# Improvements to Thrustmaster Joystick : Mid-Flight Speed Adjustments

## Introduction

We are pleased to announce the **Speed Control Rate Adjustment** feature, introducing on-the-fly speed tuning for drone pitch, roll, and yaw via joystick buttons. This enhancement provides pilots with **greater precision and adaptability**—especially when tracking and operating at different zoom levels—making surveillance, security, traffic monitoring and overall flight operations more intuitive and safe.

## Key Features

* **Enhanced Control Flexibility**\
  Dynamically adjust pitch, roll, and yaw rates in real time using your joystick buttons. No need to pause the flight to toggle control settings—simply press a button to dial speed up or down.
* **Improved Tracking at High Zoom Levels**\
  Addresses the challenge of keeping a subject in frame when operating at maximum zoom. The drone retains reduced roll/pitch rates, allowing more accurate tracking.

## **Button Bindings**

* **Increase Speed:** Button B8
* **Decrease Speed:** Button B10
* **Reset Speed:** Button B5

## **Precision Adjustment Rates**

* **Pitch/Roll:** 10% increments of max speed
* **Yaw:** 15% increments of max speed

## Benefits

* **Real-Time Tuning**: Adjust speeds on the fly for better situational awareness, eliminating awkward stops or flight-mode toggles.
* **Precise Orbits at Maximum Zoom**: More stable framing, crucial for surveillance or traffic monitoring tasks that demand close-up detail.
* **Simplified Operations**: Pilots can react swiftly to changing conditions, ensuring safer and more efficient flights without mid-mission interruptions.
