# Introducing Sites, improved Drone Telemetry interface and platform optimizations



We are thrilled to unveil the 'Sites' feature, a transformative addition to our platform. This update is specifically tailored to streamline and enhance the way resources are managed within the organization.

* Organize with Ease: Each 'site' serves as a centralized hub for resources such as devices, members, missions, and flights, promoting efficient organization.
* Exclusive Control for Owners and Admins: Creation, configuration, and deletion of sites are exclusive privileges for owners and admins, ensuring controlled and secure management.
* Site-Specific Fleet Views: Utilize sites as a filter to focus on the fleet operations of a particular site, enabling a more targeted approach to management and decision-making.

Refer to this [document ](https://docs-dji.flytbase.com/getting-started-with-your-flytbase-account/new-site-management)to learn more and get started!

We're excited to bring you another new feature that puts more control in your hands: the ability to set custom altitude and radius limits for your DJI drone right from the device zones tab. This update is all about enhancing the safety and precision of your drone operations.

* Set Maximum Altitude: You can now define the maximum altitude your drone can reach in relation to its dock. This means you have the power to ensure your drone flies at safe heights, tailored to your specific operational needs.
* Control Drone's Distance from the Dock: Determine the maximum distance your drone can travel from the dock. By setting this limit, you're ensuring that your drone stays within a safe and manageable range during its flights.
* Enforced Safety Boundaries: Once you set these limits, rest assured that your drone will respect them. It won't breach the predefined altitude or displacement boundaries, giving you peace of mind that your drone operations are safer and more controlled than ever.

#### Improvements:

* Revamped Drone Details Card for Enhanced Monitoring: The drone details card has been completely revamped to provide you with more comprehensive and accessible information.
  * Persistent Battery Information: Stay informed about your drone's battery life at all times. Even if the drone goes offline, you can now see the latest charge percentage directly on the drone card, ensuring you're always aware of its power status.
  * Organized Data Sections: We've introduced distinct sections for live health warnings, DJI dock telemetry, weather data, network and connections, and live viewers. This new organization makes it simpler to find the specific information you need when you need it.

#### Fixes:

* Fixed an issue with the status of scheduled missions in the 'Schedule' calendar view.
* Minor fixes and optimizations.
