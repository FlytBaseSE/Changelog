# New Feature: Audio Chat

FlytBase is thrilled to introduce the Audio Chat feature, now integrated into the Dashboard. This powerful tool is designed to enhance real-time coordination and team collaboration during drone operations, making it easier than ever to streamline communications directly from the FlytBase Dashboard.

**Highlights of the Audio Chat Feature:**

* **Real-time Communication**: Instantly connect with team members to discuss and manage drone operations efficiently.
* **Easy Access**: Start a group audio call with a simple click on the audio call button located on the top bar.
* **Online Status**: Easily check which team members are online and available for a chat by clicking the designated button.
* **Organization-Specific**: Communicate exclusively with members who are online and belong to the same organization for secure and focused discussions.
