# Feature Updates: Zones and Unit Conversion

Managing Geofences and No-Fly Zones (NFZs) is essential for safe, reliable drone operations and compliance with local regulations. Moreover, the ability to use preferred units of measurement is important for users in various industries who need flexibility and accuracy in their work. To address these requirements, we’ve brought updates to our **Zones** and **Units Conversion** features, improving functionality, clarity, and control. These improvements are aimed to help you manage your operations more effectively and safely.

Take a look at the details below to know more about these updates:

* **Updates to Zones**
  * Synced and unsynced Zones are now displayed on the map during all flight operations on the Dashboard, maintaining clarity and consistency.
  * Zone syncing has been consolidated into one place, ensuring smoother operations and reducing the risk of flights without synced Zones.
  * Warnings for drones stuck in chokepoints due to Zones, along with protocols for safely returning the drone, have been added to enhance operational safety.
