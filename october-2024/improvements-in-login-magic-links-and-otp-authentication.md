# Improvements in Login: Magic Links and OTP Authentication

At FlytBase, we continuously strive to enhance security while ensuring a frictionless login experience for our users. We are excited to introduce login using **Magic Links and OTP Authentication**, offering two secure and efficient ways to access your FlytBase account without the hassle of remembering passwords.

#### Key Features:

* **Magic Link & Verification Code for Quick Login:** Simply enter your email on the login page, and youâ€™ll receive an email containing both a **one-time verification code** and a **magic link**. Use the code to log in manually or click the link for instant sign-in.
* **Enhanced Security & Compliance:** By sending a unique, time-sensitive OTP and Magic Link to your verified email, FlytBase ensures **secure account access,** while mitigating risks associated with password-based authentication.
