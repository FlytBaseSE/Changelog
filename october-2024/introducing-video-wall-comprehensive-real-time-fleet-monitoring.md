#### Key Features:

* A unified dashboard displaying Dock, Drone payload, and Drone FPV video feeds from all devices.
* Option to select Dock, Drone FPV, or Drone Payload video feeds, filtered by Site.
* Options to view video feeds in full-screen or open them in dedicated browser tabs for greater flexibility.
