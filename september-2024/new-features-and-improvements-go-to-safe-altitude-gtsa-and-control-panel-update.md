To help users conduct safe and reliable Drone-Dock operations while maintaining situational awareness and ease of use, FlytBase is pleased to launch an updated **Control Panel** with a refreshed user interface. In addition to this, a new feature, **Go To Safe Altitude (GTSA)**, is also being introduced. These improvements are designed to enhance the user experience by offering intuitive operational controls and the latest safety features, making it easier to manage flight operations while ensuring safety and compliance with regulatory standards.

2. **Go To Safe Altitude (GTSA)**\
   The **Go To Safe Altitude (GTSA)** feature ensures that in case of nearby air traffic, the drone can be commanded to stop current operations and descend to a preset safe altitude, where it will hover until further instructions are given. This feature not only improves operational safety but also ensures compliance with airspace regulations in areas where this functionality is required.\
