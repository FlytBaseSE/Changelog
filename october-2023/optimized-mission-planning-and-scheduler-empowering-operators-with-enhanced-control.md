We are thrilled to introduce an update to our Mission Planning platform this month. Our aim is to empower operators with unmatched control, adaptability, and clarity during every phase of mission planning.

Here are some of the key features:

1. Diverse Waypoint Types: Navigate with precision by selecting from an array of Waypoint Types, including Transits Waypoint, Curved Route, Controlled Radius, and Linear Route. These choices provide operators with enhanced control over the drone's path during missions.
2. Camera Mode Customizations: Optimize your data capture by specifying camera modes for individual waypoints, ensuring every shot is captured as intended.
3. Advanced Waypoint Actions: Define and sequence Waypoint Actions, ensuring they trigger in the desired order as the drone arrives at each location.
4. WPML Mission Flexibility: Seamlessly edit WPML missions imported from third-party platforms, offering you greater adaptability in mission execution.
5. Revamped User Interface: Experience a more intuitive and streamlined mission planning process, complemented by a clear visualization of the mission's projected trajectory.

Beyond these spotlight features, we've infused numerous other enhancements to refine your mission planning journey. To learn more, refer to this [document](https://docs-dji.flytbase.com/pre-flight-modules/planning/mission-planning/path-mission).

### **Mission Scheduler Improvements:**

Based on the feedback we've received from our community of FlytBase Operators, we have now introduced a new frequency setting in the Scheduler. You can now schedule missions at quicker intervals that can be set for as low as 5 minutes!

To get started with the new mission scheduler, refer to this [document](https://docs-dji.flytbase.com/pre-flight-modules/planning/mission-scheduler).
