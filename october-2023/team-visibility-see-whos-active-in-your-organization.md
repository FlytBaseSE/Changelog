# Team Visibility: See Who's Active in Your Organization

In the world of remote drone operations, it's essential to have a team that communicates effectively and is in sync with each other. Whether you're conducting surveillance, monitoring traffic, or inspecting buildings, you need a team that is on the same page to ensure success. However, managing a large enterprise team can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to gauging the real-time engagement of the members who are actively participating in your organization. Who's monitoring the live operations? Who's in control during critical missions? These questions are pivotal for seamless remote operations. That's why we're introducing the Live Users feature - the overall goal? Enhancing your team's connectivity and visibility!

* üë• See Who's Online: Organization members can now view all online members in drone details, fostering better team collaboration.
* üñºÔ∏è Visual Member Count: Get a clearer picture of the online member count complemented by their profile images and roles in the organization.

Note: While this feature offers real-time insights, it operates independently of the drone's status. As we roll out fleet and single drone views in the upcoming releases, anticipate a richer, more integrated experience where you can see who is viewing the operations of a particular drone, and who's taken control during live operations.
